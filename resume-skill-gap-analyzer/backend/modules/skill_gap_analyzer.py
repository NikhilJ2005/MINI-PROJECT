 Skill Gap Analyzer Module
=============================================================================
 Role in the pipeline:
   This is the FIFTH stage. It takes the parsed resume skills, GitHub
   demonstrated skills, ML predictions, and the target job role's
   requirements — then computes a comprehensive gap analysis.

 Key metrics computed:
   - match_score:   Percentage of required skills the candidate has (0-100)
   - gap_score:     Percentage of required skills missing (0-100)
   - confidence:    ML model's average confidence in the candidate's skills
   - Per-skill status: strong / claimed_only / demonstrated_only / missing

        Perform a full skill gap analysis for a candidate against a target role.

        Business logic for skill status classification:
          - "strong":            Skill found in BOTH resume AND GitHub
                                 → Strongest evidence — candidate has coded it AND claims it
          - "claimed_only":      Skill found in resume but NOT on GitHub
                                 → Candidate claims it but hasn't demonstrated it publicly
          - "demonstrated_only": Skill found on GitHub but NOT in resume
                                 → Hidden strength — candidate uses it but didn't highlight it
          - "missing":           Skill found in NEITHER source
                                 → This is a gap that needs to be addressed

        Scoring:

          - gap_score   = 100 - match_score
          - confidence  = average ML probability for present required skills

        Args:
            claimed_skills:      Skills extracted from the resume.
            demonstrated_skills: Skills found on GitHub.
            target_role:         The job role to compare against.
            job_roles_data:      The full job roles dictionary.
            ml_predictions:      Dict with lr_predictions, dt_predictions keys.
            probabilities:    List of LR probability scores per skill.
            skill_matrix:        The skill matrix DataFrame from feature engineering.
